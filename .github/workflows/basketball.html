Basketball is a team sport played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective of the game is to score points by throwing or shooting a ball through the opponent's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court). A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.

Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world, and is played by people of all ages and skill levels. It is a relatively inexpensive sport to play, and can be enjoyed both indoors and outdoors. Basketball is also a great way to get exercise and have fun with friends.
